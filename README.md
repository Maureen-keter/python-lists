# List Operations Assignment â€“ Python

## Description

This assignment demonstrates fundamental Python list operations. The task involves creating and manipulating a list using standard built-in methods.

## Tasks Completed

The script performs the following operations in sequence:

1. Creates an empty list named `my_list`.
2. Appends the values `10`, `20`, `30`, and `40` to `my_list`.
3. Inserts the value `15` at the second position (index `1`).
4. Extends the list with another list: `[50, 60, 70]`.
5. Removes the last element from `my_list`.
6. Sorts the list in ascending order.
7. Finds and prints the index of the value `30`.

## Example Output

Final list:

```python
[10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]
```

## Usage

To run the script:

```bash
python3 ls.py
```

Ensure you are using **Python 3.x**.
